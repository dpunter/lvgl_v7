# lvgl_v7

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

Purely experimental code at this stage.

Sorry about the name - this im my testing version V7.
LVGL 8.3.9

This is a real world example running on a SUNTON ESP32-8048S043

It is also running painless mesh to;
1) Receive temperature and himidity from another ESP32 / DHT22
2) Sen messages to a LILYGO 8-Port relay board to turn on and off relays / switches.
